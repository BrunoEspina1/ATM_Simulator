Welcome to the Windows ATM Machine project! In this endeavor, I've meticulously recreated an ATM machine using C#. But that's not all; I've also crafted a comprehensive login and registration system that allows you to create an account with a unique account number, PIN, and name.

Secure Database Storage
All user account information is securely stored in a relational database, skillfully managed through SQL queries. Your "financial data" is in safe hands!

ATM Functionalities
Here's what this Windows ATM Machine can do:

Send Money: Seamlessly transfer funds to other accounts, making managing your finances a breeze.

Transaction History: Keep track of your financial moves by viewing the last transactions made from your account.

Cash Withdrawals: Withdraw money from your account to access physical currency, just like a traditional ATM machine.

Please note that the ATM interface, including text prompts, variables, and code comments, are all in Spanish, providing a comprehensive and immersive experience for Spanish-speaking users.

Whether you're exploring this project for educational purposes or considering its practical applications, you'll find a comprehensive and user-friendly ATM system at your fingertips!
